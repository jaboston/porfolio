# porfolio
Just a quick portfolio I coded

# Built with Atom IDE
- Using scss file for styling and auto converting to css using scss-save
- Using autoprefixing with autoprefixer plugin by sindresorhus
- Using js-beautify command line and installed via node
- linter-stylelint
- linter-tidy
- w3c-validation by leny

# Tested

- Internet explorer tends to render the buttons without an inner colour
- No other notable issues
